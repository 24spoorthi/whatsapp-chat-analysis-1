176,27/01/2020,10:34 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)","#include <conio.h> #include <stdio.h>  void main() { int i, j, l; l = 5;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) { for (j = 0; j < l; j++) { printf(""* ""); }  for (j = 0; j < 4 * i; j++) { printf("" ""); }  for (j = 0; j < l; j++) { printf(""* ""); }  l--;  printf(""\n""); }  l = 0;  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) { for (j = l; j >= 0; j--) { printf(""* ""); }  for (j = 4 * (5 - i) - 4; j > 0; j--) { printf("" ""); }  for (j = l; j >= 0; j--) { printf(""* ""); }  l++;  printf(""\n""); } }"
177,27/01/2020,10:35 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",you can ignore l=0; in second part
178,27/01/2020,10:42 pm,+91 96536 93868,Your code is static  bro ... there must be an  input ...

298,28/01/2020,7:30 pm,"Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS)",It has something to do with how second condition of B is placed.
299,28/01/2020,7:30 pm,+91 99201 75875,Assuming you're not supposed to used in built sort functions right?
300,28/01/2020,7:30 pm,"Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS)",Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
301,28/01/2020,7:31 pm,"Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS)",You get a totally different output

307,28/01/2020,7:47 pm,"Saket (TSEC, CS)",In-built
308,28/01/2020,7:48 pm,Tushar Nankani,Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
309,28/01/2020,7:49 pm,Tushar Nankani,The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
310,28/01/2020,7:50 pm,"Saket (TSEC, CS)",So conclusion is If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
311,28/01/2020,7:51 pm,Tushar Nankani,"Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using ""OR"". And not ""AND""."

388,29/01/2020,10:47 pm,"Saket (TSEC, CS)","This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24. To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler."

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.  Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.    *Input:*  The first line contains a single integer N.  Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.    *Output:*  Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!    *Constraints:*  1 < N < 105  0 < Ak < 109"

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.  Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.    *Input:*  The first line contains a single integer N.  Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.    *Output:*  Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!    *Constraints:*  1 < N < 105  0 < Ak < 109"

In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better. The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest. Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty. The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

Codeforces  Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces  Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated . Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
3327,17/03/2020,1:16 pm,+91 73043 57388,"Ok everyone so let's start Road to CP 1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not. Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something. Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it. Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible 2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP. 3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend) Check out this video  https://youtu.be/4VD5wpLq1EQ  This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering  I know him personally. We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef Follow each and every point he told in the video.  Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.  Second person Rachit jain Ex Microsoft Engineer 6th star coder at codechef follow his YouTube channel for guidance and specially his video how I mastered Data Structures and Algorithms"

3333,17/03/2020,1:17 pm,+91 73043 57388,One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
3334,17/03/2020,1:17 pm,+91 73043 57388,Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.  But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
3335,17/03/2020,1:17 pm,,"+91 73043 57388: For FE students: In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics Don't dare to jump on DSA. For Second year: Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews. What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem."

In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class Hence, implicit call *But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation."

In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better. The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest. Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty. The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem. Good luck!

3699,21/03/2020,5:03 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get. In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better. The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest. Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty. The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem. Good luck!

So I will be organising a workshop on ML:  *Where:* Online  *Time:* next week, time suitable to all  *Cost*: üÜì  Lets make the most of the time, that we have in abundance due to lockdown, to discover and gain a basic idea as to what ML is! *Those interested please fill out the form:*  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRAs17JL2S7Ynm5LdHXLEmkzZ2mIONcXPgGSaKdwKJNDXjBA/viewform?usp=sf_link"

4262,31/03/2020,3:37 pm,,Tushar Nankani: The workshop would consist of the following topics: Numpy and Pandas Data Preprocessing(using Numpy and Pandas) Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
4263,31/03/2020,3:39 pm,Tushar Nankani,"The above three are branches of ML. A proper introduction would be given, along with one or two models in it for understanding. Though there will be a prerequisite of python, but he'll be going through the basics at the start. He will try to explain a few projects, share the code for us to understand."

4419,05/04/2020,5:17 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses. Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m. For example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter. Given a string of digits S, find another string S', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that: all parentheses in S' match some other parenthesis, removing any and all parentheses from S' results in S, each digit in S' is equal to its nesting depth, and S' is of minimum length. Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line represents a test case and contains only the string S. Output For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the string S' defined above. Limits Time limit: 20 seconds per test set. Memory limit: 1GB. 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 100. 1 ‚â§ length of S ‚â§ 100. Test set 1 (Visible Verdict) Each character in S is either 0 or 1. Test set 2 (Visible Verdict) Each character in S is a decimal digit between 0 and 9, inclusive. Sample  Input  4 0000 101 111000 1  Output Case #1: 0000 Case #2: (1)0(1) Case #3: (111)000 Case #4: (1)   The strings ()0000(), (1)0(((()))1) and (1)(11)000 are not valid solutions to Sample Cases #1, #2 and #3, respectively, only because they are not of minimum length. In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1. You can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement."

4421,05/04/2020,5:19 pm,+91 82916 21138,Use stack

4447,07/04/2020,1:59 am,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",I mean its a non-primitive data type right?

4449,07/04/2020,2:12 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is the reason why it is always encouraged to have a datatype in the ArrayList.

4553,11/04/2020,8:42 pm,+91 73043 57388,"Interfaces are used when objects have common properties  For example Students common properties are Nane roll no DOB Etc So student class can be parent class And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc So these branches becomes child classes"

The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns"

4556,11/04/2020,8:53 pm,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Yeah
4557,11/04/2020,9:01 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread. Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.  Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class."
4558,11/04/2020,9:04 pm,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Yeah makes sense Thank you
4559,11/04/2020,9:04 pm,+91 97681 67131,So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?

It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

4966,18/04/2020,10:19 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",No need of recursion
4967,18/04/2020,10:21 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",If there is an even element in array there is an answer consisting of only it. Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

4973,18/04/2020,11:12 pm,+91 73043 57388,The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion  For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one  So suppose u have Given array 1 2 3 4 And u wan to find all possible subsets  We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop  For(i=0;i<n;i++) { temp[0]=arr[i]; Recursion_func }  We draw a recursion tree for that

5517,30/04/2020,5:32 pm,+91 99693 94098,"Hey everyone, I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy. After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.  Repository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector  A small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset  Thank you for your time!"

I will work hard to fix it. My recent tests show that this can dramatically increase judging time (and leads to a huge queue). I don't want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!

Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose. 1) Divide the numbers in group of k. 2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort ) Merge sort all the groups. 3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k. 4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group. 5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file. 6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged. 7) Update the min heap. 8) Go to step 5.    *Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*  1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ. The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements. 2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time. If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group. Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group. 3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ. 4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order. 5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.  _In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._ _where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._"

6667,28/05/2020,2:29 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Vanilla* CSS
6668,28/05/2020,2:30 am,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In my opinion: Always."
6669,28/05/2020,2:30 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",CSS => Complete Suffering & Sadness
6670,28/05/2020,2:30 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ohh....
6671,28/05/2020,2:30 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Definitely look to libraries for inspiration, and feel free to copy whatever you like."
6672,28/05/2020,2:31 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Smart!
6673,28/05/2020,2:31 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Agreed
6674,28/05/2020,2:31 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website."
6675,28/05/2020,2:31 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ......"
6676,28/05/2020,2:31 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Ohh Alright
6677,28/05/2020,2:32 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries.
6678,28/05/2020,2:32 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Oh ..
6679,28/05/2020,2:32 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects..."
6680,28/05/2020,2:33 am,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it."
6681,28/05/2020,2:33 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh
6682,28/05/2020,2:34 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries."
6683,28/05/2020,2:34 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.
6684,28/05/2020,2:34 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools."
6685,28/05/2020,2:34 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",What is a CDN is used?
6686,28/05/2020,2:34 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",If*
6687,28/05/2020,2:35 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",We're having real talks at 2.35 AM This is fucking awesome!!!!!
6688,28/05/2020,2:35 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",üëèüëè
6689,28/05/2020,2:35 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",A CDN can only speed up the download times.
6690,28/05/2020,2:36 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.
6691,28/05/2020,2:37 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...  Now if you're saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...  My vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this: https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/"
6692,28/05/2020,2:37 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines."
6693,28/05/2020,2:38 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.
6694,28/05/2020,2:38 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it"
6695,28/05/2020,2:38 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","You sure do have a point But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....  I just want to show off my backend functionality..... Then what should I do?"
6696,28/05/2020,2:38 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?
6697,28/05/2020,2:40 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line."
6698,28/05/2020,2:40 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library."
6699,28/05/2020,2:40 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh yeah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
6700,28/05/2020,2:40 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",True true
6701,28/05/2020,2:41 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","However, there is something called ""Tree Shaking"" where unused portions of the library are removed."
6702,28/05/2020,2:42 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.
6703,28/05/2020,2:42 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Ohh
6704,28/05/2020,2:42 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And you lose the benefit of a CDN.
6705,28/05/2020,2:43 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",?
6706,28/05/2020,2:44 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, what backend functionality?"
6707,28/05/2020,2:44 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Give me an example.
6708,28/05/2020,2:44 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Suppose, I'm building a rest api.."
6709,28/05/2020,2:45 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Tbh I used a template for Attendance Manager v1
6710,28/05/2020,2:45 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",It was just a backend project then...
6711,28/05/2020,2:45 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeahh You told me once ... Now I remember....
6712,28/05/2020,2:45 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end..."
6713,28/05/2020,2:47 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website."
6714,28/05/2020,2:48 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.
6715,28/05/2020,2:48 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)","Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap"
6716,28/05/2020,2:48 am,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",No idea what should be done...
6717,28/05/2020,2:49 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Don't use flex box.. Why do you need??
6718,28/05/2020,2:50 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Bootstrap handles it all na?
6719,28/05/2020,2:54 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.
6720,28/05/2020,2:54 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Try CSS Grid.
6721,28/05/2020,2:55 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ohh that is absolute beauty  .....
6722,28/05/2020,2:55 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I've used it ....
6723,28/05/2020,2:55 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Its lengthy, But it works... It works perfectly It works always...."
6724,28/05/2020,2:56 am,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Somebody put it nicely: ""Grid is how CSS should have been designed in the first place""."

6736,28/05/2020,3:00 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client."
6737,28/05/2020,3:00 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It will greatly reduce the load on the server.
6738,28/05/2020,3:00 am,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Yeah...

6742,28/05/2020,3:07 am,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater. I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it. But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library."

7078,05/06/2020,6:01 pm,+91 97681 67131,Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better
7079,05/06/2020,6:02 pm,+91 97681 67131,Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back

7264,10/06/2020,6:24 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But updataing to Pro is trivial.  https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator

7269,10/06/2020,6:29 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS). This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue. But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid.
7270,10/06/2020,6:30 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Is it like piracy?
7271,10/06/2020,6:31 pm,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Oh lol üòÇ
7272,10/06/2020,6:31 pm,"Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE)",Why have they not done something to solve it!?

7277,10/06/2020,6:33 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README.

7279,10/06/2020,6:50 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux."
7280,10/06/2020,6:50 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You can actually run a Windows 98 program on Windows 10 and it shoud run fine.

7332,12/06/2020,10:37 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes getting used to command line...but as a beginner better to use an IDE like BlueJ
7333,12/06/2020,10:38 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",But no one is going to tell you that their should be written in a notepad or something
7334,12/06/2020,10:38 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I too like to use the command line for simple programs, but USE AN EDITOR. Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode. But DON'T USE NOTEPAD."

7336,12/06/2020,10:40 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",IDE's help you a lot!!!
7337,12/06/2020,10:43 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Exactly You don't want the beginner to get too much help
7338,12/06/2020,10:44 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Then you use Bluej
7339,12/06/2020,10:44 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete"

7343,12/06/2020,10:53 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner

7349,12/06/2020,11:07 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",I feel that Immediate help is harmful
7350,12/06/2020,11:07 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner."
7351,12/06/2020,11:08 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)","Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too"
7352,12/06/2020,11:09 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels. Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit."

7370,12/06/2020,11:24 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible.
7371,12/06/2020,11:24 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot
7372,12/06/2020,11:25 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot.
7373,12/06/2020,11:26 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide

Also I was thinking it‚Äôll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it‚Äôll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia‚Å© has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday) and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session  https://t.me/joinchat/K0eakBhoBEu3ktTwM3cLtg

8164,28/06/2020,9:23 pm,+91 75078 05454,This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app.
8165,28/06/2020,9:25 pm,+91 75078 05454,It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS.
8166,28/06/2020,9:25 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",How exactly/
8167,28/06/2020,9:26 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","This is an app development platform, right?"
8168,28/06/2020,9:26 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone.
8169,28/06/2020,9:29 pm,+91 75078 05454,Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace.
8170,28/06/2020,9:29 pm,+91 75078 05454,Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets
8171,28/06/2020,9:33 pm,+91 75078 05454,They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .
8172,28/06/2020,9:33 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","OK, that makes some sense."

8181,28/06/2020,10:02 pm,+91 75078 05454,The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations
8182,28/06/2020,10:03 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",My point exactly.
8183,28/06/2020,10:04 pm,+91 75078 05454,But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations
8184,28/06/2020,10:04 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind."
8185,28/06/2020,10:05 pm,+91 75078 05454,?
8186,28/06/2020,10:07 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for."
8187,28/06/2020,10:08 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts.
8188,28/06/2020,10:08 pm,+91 75078 05454,That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform
8189,28/06/2020,10:09 pm,+91 75078 05454,From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses
8190,28/06/2020,10:10 pm,+91 75078 05454,But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress
8191,28/06/2020,10:11 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open.
8192,28/06/2020,10:12 pm,+91 75078 05454,That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform
8193,28/06/2020,10:13 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",That is true.
8194,28/06/2020,10:14 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic.
8195,28/06/2020,10:15 pm,+91 75078 05454,Yeah that's true

8563,07/07/2020,9:21 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.  I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.

8703,10/07/2020,5:04 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",is it ok to use Git 2.26 or should I upgrade to Git 2.27?
8704,10/07/2020,5:12 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",.01 don't make much difference
8705,10/07/2020,5:12 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",ohk
8706,10/07/2020,5:12 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",But it is always good to upgradeüôÉ
8707,10/07/2020,5:12 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Unless it's windows updateüòÇ
8708,10/07/2020,5:12 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",üòÇ
8709,10/07/2020,5:13 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Depends. You should read the changelog and see if new features were added.
8710,10/07/2020,5:13 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",will check
8711,10/07/2020,5:13 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",For example git sparse-checkout was added in a 0.1 update.
8712,10/07/2020,5:13 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",oh
8713,10/07/2020,5:13 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And so was git switch and git restore.
8714,10/07/2020,5:14 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",Yaa but most of the time .01 is likely to be a bug fix
8715,10/07/2020,5:14 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, most of the time it is true."
8716,10/07/2020,5:15 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",But somtimes features are added/changed from experimental to stable.
8717,10/07/2020,5:15 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Best way is to read the changelog.
8718,10/07/2020,5:21 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",U have sooo many things on your device it is very tough to read all the changelogs... especially for a person like who rarely updatesüòÖ

8720,10/07/2020,5:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I like reading changelogs.
8721,10/07/2020,5:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And then trying out the new features.
8722,10/07/2020,5:23 pm,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",If it's in front of me then i read agar it's redirecting me to another webpage or something then I just let it update

8740,10/07/2020,7:21 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",What is HomeBrew ? Is this for Mac only?
8741,10/07/2020,7:21 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Not technially, no."
8742,10/07/2020,7:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It was developed as a package mangager for Mac.
8743,10/07/2020,7:22 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",But what is HomeBrew?
8744,10/07/2020,7:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Similar to apt and apk.
8745,10/07/2020,7:22 pm,+91 97681 67131,Package manager like Linux has apt...
8746,10/07/2020,7:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Exactly.
8747,10/07/2020,7:23 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It is also availiable for linux.
8748,10/07/2020,7:24 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It has limited use, except in very rare situations. One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system."
8749,10/07/2020,7:24 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Means you don't have to be root to install software.
8750,10/07/2020,7:25 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","You can ""isolate"" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory."
8751,10/07/2020,7:25 pm,+91 97681 67131,Are u trying to install git?? That‚Äôs why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac
8752,10/07/2020,7:26 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah
8753,10/07/2020,7:26 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Oh acha
8754,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X"
8755,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.
8756,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos"
8757,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeahh thats what i did
8758,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah
8759,10/07/2020,7:28 pm,+91 97681 67131,I don‚Äôt think that works in terminal on OSX
8760,10/07/2020,7:29 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",not only git i did 'brew install git'
8761,10/07/2020,7:31 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec"
8762,10/07/2020,7:31 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah i installed HomeBrew first
8763,10/07/2020,7:31 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",then through terminal i did brew install git
8764,10/07/2020,7:32 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too"
8765,10/07/2020,7:32 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there..."
8766,10/07/2020,7:32 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah i have Xcode
8767,10/07/2020,7:33 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Software update section?
8768,10/07/2020,7:33 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there"
8769,10/07/2020,7:33 pm,+91 97681 67131,I mean where u get os updates
8770,10/07/2020,7:34 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It just shows Your mac is up to date
8771,10/07/2020,7:35 pm,+91 97681 67131,Try running git‚Äîversion command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used.
8772,10/07/2020,7:36 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah it gives the version number
8773,10/07/2020,7:36 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",git is installed
8774,10/07/2020,7:36 pm,+91 97681 67131,Then it‚Äôs installed
8775,10/07/2020,7:36 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just wanted to know about Home Brew
8776,10/07/2020,7:36 pm,+91 97681 67131,Oh üòÇ Ya oh I thought stuck with installing
8777,10/07/2020,7:37 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",loll
8778,10/07/2020,7:37 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",XCode has old packages sometimes. Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0.
8779,10/07/2020,7:38 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",I'll check
8780,10/07/2020,7:38 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",just a sec
8781,10/07/2020,7:38 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yup its 2.27.0
8782,10/07/2020,7:38 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Great!
8783,10/07/2020,7:39 pm,+91 97681 67131,"Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc"

8789,10/07/2020,7:40 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies."
8790,10/07/2020,7:40 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",apt uses dpkg internally.
8791,10/07/2020,7:40 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",It went over my head lol
8792,10/07/2020,7:40 pm,+91 97681 67131,Ya ya.. it‚Äôs installer sorry
8793,10/07/2020,7:42 pm,+91 97681 67131,But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??
8794,10/07/2020,7:43 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies. But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order."
8795,10/07/2020,7:43 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager."

Core Java - it is important to start with core Java for understanding the fundamental in Java programming.  Servlets - JSP and Servlet are important to understand the web technologies  Java EE  Spring Framework  Hibernate Framework    Java is a very vast language and used in various forms like Socket programming, Web Application development, Portal designing, Android applications, Purely Backend developments using Webservices and lot more. So first decide what you want to learn.  Learn accordingly.  1. Core Java : Most Important . Learn all the concepts don‚Äôt miss a single one. Its the heart and soul of Java  2. JSP and Servlet : These are basics of Web application development. Earlier all the applications were made using these technology but now they are just a part of Web development.  3. JDBC : You should be familiar with this concepts . Your daily life belongs to this only. Learn basics of SQL language also for CRUD operation.  4.Spring: The most useful framework which is used for various applications .  5.Hibernate: Its useful for DB interaction at the highest speed.  You can follow the 12345 all for a Spring web application development.  You can follow 1235 for Hibernate developer.  You can learn only 1 for Socket programming.  If you want to be a Android developer then learn only 1 and then proceed to android studio.  Except this you can learn JSF and Webservices for better knowledge and work"

9012,19/07/2020,10:26 am,+91 82916 21138,I found some good question and answer
9013,19/07/2020,10:26 am,,"+91 82916 21138: Prashasti Agarwal: I am graduating this year and I have job offer of 3-4 LPA. Should I focus on preparing for GATE or for DSA and CP?  Satbir Singh: It's your wish. Remember GATE will give one chance per year to prove your worth whereas if you do CP and you're prepared you can get many chance to attend various interviews.  Anurag Goel: After doing GATE, you will be doing M.Tech and again focussing on coding skills, Cp and DSA  for placement season after 2 years.  So it would be better if you switch your 3-4 lpa to 8-10+ lpa in product based company by learning those coding skills self. I've been exactly at the same position as you are today and can feel the dilemma but if job is the end goal, better to grind yourself now with DSA coding skills along with existing job."

9201,22/07/2020,5:22 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",```int largestPrimeFactor(int n){ if(n <= 3) return n;  int f = 1; while(n > 1){ f++; while(n % f == 0) n /= f; }  return f; }```
9202,22/07/2020,5:23 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers.
9203,22/07/2020,5:26 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",``` vector<int> divs; int check(int x) { if(x <= 1) return -1;  for (int i = 2; i * i <= x ; ++i) { if(x%i == 0) { divs.push_back(i); while(x % i == 0) { x = x / i; } } }  if(divs.empty())divs.push_back(x);  return divs.back(); }```
9204,22/07/2020,5:26 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",try this
9205,22/07/2020,5:29 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",1. Java 2. No need for a vector
9206,22/07/2020,5:30 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","this will TLE if n is prime. But I think there isn't any time constraint on Udemy, so this will also work"
9207,22/07/2020,5:30 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Why?
9208,22/07/2020,5:30 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Lets say N is 10^9 + 7
9209,22/07/2020,5:30 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Use n = 5
9210,22/07/2020,5:30 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times

9212,22/07/2020,5:31 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Easier.
9213,22/07/2020,5:31 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",And no.
9214,22/07/2020,5:31 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Wait, is 10e9 + 7 prime?"
9215,22/07/2020,5:31 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yes it will

9218,22/07/2020,5:31 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Ah, then yes."
9219,22/07/2020,5:32 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)","Here I have optimized it. Consider any number N, if its not prime then it'll definitely have a factor <= sqrt(N)"
9220,22/07/2020,5:33 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",so Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))

9222,22/07/2020,5:33 pm,"Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE)",Yeah both solutions should work

9821,13/08/2020,2:29 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java?
9822,13/08/2020,2:29 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",It ultimately falls back to C/C++

11123,03/09/2020,12:48 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Dummy string right?

11125,03/09/2020,12:48 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",.
11126,03/09/2020,12:51 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",It's to clear the channel. The previous input ka enter is still in the channel And if I don't give s.nextLine(); Before the string input Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable  So isliye To avoid that.
11127,03/09/2020,12:51 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",üò§
11128,03/09/2020,12:52 pm,+91 97027 35002,Just remember to this whenever you take a interger etc input before taking string input

11134,03/09/2020,12:52 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Ok sir.

11137,03/09/2020,12:53 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines."
11138,03/09/2020,12:54 pm,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs: ```10\nHello, World!\n```"
11139,03/09/2020,12:54 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Didn't see the code
11140,03/09/2020,12:54 pm,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS)",Yes ik
11141,03/09/2020,12:54 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Okay
11142,03/09/2020,12:55 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does."
11143,03/09/2020,12:55 pm,+91 97027 35002,Explain sir
11144,03/09/2020,12:55 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace."
11145,03/09/2020,12:56 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/```
11146,03/09/2020,12:56 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits."
11147,03/09/2020,12:57 pm,+91 97027 35002,Okay
11148,03/09/2020,12:57 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it."
11149,03/09/2020,12:57 pm,,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\nHello, World!\n```"
11150,03/09/2020,12:58 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does."
11151,03/09/2020,12:59 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer."
11152,03/09/2020,1:00 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```)."
11153,03/09/2020,1:00 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",(without the newline)
11154,03/09/2020,1:01 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)","So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline."
11155,03/09/2020,1:01 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",So basically It returned nothing in my case
11156,03/09/2020,1:01 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Which means it will return an empty string.
11157,03/09/2020,1:01 pm,"Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS)",Yes.
11158,03/09/2020,1:02 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)",Alright. Got it. Thank you.

11966,13/09/2020,2:13 pm,,"Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): here is the answer:  Answer: b)num1 == num2 num3 != num4 Reason: We always thought that whenever two object references are compared using ‚Äú==‚Äù, it always evaluates to ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That‚Äôs why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference."

12460,20/09/2020,11:11 am,Tushar Nankani,"I wouldn't mind such initiatives, that would help maintain the gender ratio!  Just that, it's rather sad the score difference is so vast!   Microsoft already has women in tech, Google has women techmaker's scholarship and so many more opportunities by other firms. There should be more gender neutral opportunities, based upon _skills._   I think, even if they have such opportunities, to maintain the ratio, at least score difference shouldn't be so much.  It's a debatable topic, and this is purely my point of view."
12461,20/09/2020,11:13 am,+91 88284 70904,If they r conducting a coding competition then obviously it should purely be on merit and plus they haven‚Äôt specified that it‚Äôs for women only or something. So in this case I think it‚Äôs completely wrong
12462,20/09/2020,11:14 am,"Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT)",In my opinion if they want to take only a specific gender then only allow them to compete...why to waste others time and make them feel bad of them selfs

Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.  Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.  If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me."

If x has only digit, then its super digit is x. Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.   For example, the super digit of 9875 will be calculated as:  super_digit(9875)        9+8+7+5 = 29  super_digit(29)            2 + 9 = 11  super_digit(11)            1 + 1 = 2  super_digit(2)              = 2"

13159,27/09/2020,2:35 pm,"Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS)","Hey there,  The other day I read this story of a fledgling Python coder named Seth on Reddit:  Seth's been learning Python for 5 months, and things have been ""hit and miss"" for a while now.  A few weeks ago he completed a free coding course. But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.  Seth's doing fine at the small exercises‚Äîwrite a function here, reverse this list there‚Äîbut when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can't get them to work.  When Seth embarked on his ""coding journey"" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn't really feel enthusiastic about anything.  It's not like his motivation is dead and gone‚Äî  Every time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.  But the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.  Seth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks.  Seth still feels like a ""noob,"" and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.  How come Seth's progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?  Seth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with.  And he doesn't feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There's no going back or going forward.  I call this ""Python Paralysis""...  When you're tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don't become professional programmers!  The real problem isn't the effort itself, it's all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.  If you're wondering, I speak from experience here.  Seth's story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that's learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.  If you're in the same spot right now, here's what you need to realize:  If you get through this and keep pressing forward, you're going to get to a stage that's a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.  It takes guts and determination to make it past the ""paralysis"" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain.  Let me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?  When it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.  That's when you need to keep pushing forward, that's when you're oh so close to getting your reward, but you don't see it yet.  Don't throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward.  And take another step towards your goal.  ‚Äî Dan Bader"
