When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24. To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler. \n",

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.  Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.     *Input:*  The first line contains a single integer N.  Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.     *Output:*  Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!     *Constraints:*  1 < N < 105  0 < Ak < 109 \n",

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.  Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.     *Input:*  The first line contains a single integer N.  Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.     *Output:*  Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!     *Constraints:*  1 < N < 105  0 < Ak < 109 \n",

Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually. \n",
            "457)  Ok everyone so let's start Road to CP 1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not. Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something. Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it. Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible 2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP. 3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend) Check out this video  https://youtu.be/4VD5wpLq1EQ  This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering  I know him personally. We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef  Follow each and every point he told in the video.  Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.  Second person  Rachit jain Ex Microsoft Engineer 6th star coder at codechef follow his YouTube channel for guidance and specially his video  how I mastered Data Structures and Algorithms \n",

            "472)  This is an implicit call for the constructor. You never explicitly call the constructor. When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly. \n",
            "473)  Okay you can call another constructor explicitly from a constructor, but not otherwise. \n",
            "474)  OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?  You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.  If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call. \n",
            "475)  Ok so this is how I have learnt it. In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class Hence, implicit call *But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation. \n",

            "740)  Hey everyone, I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy. After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.  Repository Link- https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/COVID-19-Detector  A small version of the dataset on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/covid19-detection-xray-dataset  Thank you for your time! \n",

            "784)  *Sort 10 billion numbers*  10 billion numbers are given, sort them   *Approach 1 :-  (External Sorting)* Here k is the size of maximum elements which  can be sorted internally. Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose. 1) Divide the numbers in group of k. 2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )     Merge sort all the groups. 3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k. 4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group. 5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file. 6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged. 7) Update the min heap. 8) Go to step 5.    *Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*  1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.    The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements. 2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.    If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.    Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group. 3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ. 4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order. 5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.  _In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._ _where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._ \n",

If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better \n",

If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use?  Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader \n",

            "1399)  .01 don't make much difference \n",
            "1400)  But it is always good to upgradeüôÉ \n",
            "1401)  Depends. You should read the changelog and see if new features were added. \n",
            "1402)  Yaa but most of the time .01 is likely to be a bug fix \n",
            "1403)  Yes, most of the time it is true. \n",
            "1404)  But somtimes features are added/changed from experimental to stable. \n",
            "1405)  Best way is to read the changelog. \n",
            "1406)  U have sooo many things on your device it is very tough to read all the changelogs... especially for a person like who rarely updatesüòÖ \n",
            "1407)  Really? \n",
            "1408)  And then trying out the new features. \n",
            "1409)  There is no limitation of resources.  Resources are abundant.  There's only lack of Zeal/determination to work. \n",
            "1410)  true \n",
            "1411)  These are so nice \n",
            "1412)  Thanks \n",
            "1413)  It was developed as a package mangager for Mac. \n",
            "1414)  Similar to apt and apk. \n",
            "1415)  Package manager like Linux has apt... \n",
            "1416)  Exactly. \n",
            "1417)  It has limited use, except in very rare situations. One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system. \n",
            "1418)  Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X \n",
            "1419)  Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec \n",
            "1420)  Yeah i installed HomeBrew first \n",
            "1421)  Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there \n",
            "1422)  XCode has old packages sometimes. Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0. \n",
            "1423)  Great! \n",
            "1424)  Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc \n",
            "1425)  Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 ! \n",
            "1426)  Thanks \n",
            "1427)  apt uses dpkg internally. \n",
            "1428)  It went over my head lol \n",
            "1429)  But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right?? \n",
            "1430)  Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies. But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order. \n",
            "1431)  Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager. \n",
            "1432)  Yes.. true \n",
            "1433)  Me too lol \n",
